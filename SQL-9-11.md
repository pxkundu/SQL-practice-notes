| member_id | name       | age |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| 1         | Alice      | 30  |
| 2         | Bob        | 58  |
| 3         | Charlie    | 33  |
| 4         | Diana      | 55  |

| 10        | Jack       | 3   |

#### Table: `parent_child_relationships`
| parent_id | child_id |
|-----------|----------|
| 2         | 1        |
| 3         | 5        |
| 4         | 1        |
| 6         | 7        |
| 6         | 8        |
| 7         | 9        |
| 7         | 10       |
| 4         | 8        |

#### Solution:
```sql
WITH ChildCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        p.name AS parent_name,
        COUNT(r.child_id) AS total_children
    FROM 
        family_members p
    JOIN 
        parent_child_relationships r ON p.member_id = r.parent_id
    GROUP BY 
        p.name
)
SELECT 
    parent_name,
    total_children
FROM 
    ChildCounts
ORDER BY 
    total_children DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`WITH ChildCounts`**:
   - Joins `family_members` with `parent_child_relationships` to calculate the number of children for each parent.
   - Groups by `parent_name` to count children for each parent.
2. **Main Query**:
   - Sorts parents by the total number of children in descending order.
   - Limits the result to the top 3 parents.

#### Output:
| parent_name | total_children |
|-------------|----------------|
| Frank       | 3              |
| Diana       | 2              |
| Grace       | 2              |

| 5       | 3         | Santa Pin           | 2        |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    v.vendor_name
FROM 
    vendors v
JOIN 
    item_prices ip ON v.vendor_id = ip.vendor_id
WHERE 
    ip.price_usd < 10;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`JOIN`**:
   - Joins `vendors` and `item_prices` tables to identify items and their vendors.
2. **`WHERE ip.price_usd < 10`**:
   - Filters for items priced below $10.
3. **`SELECT DISTINCT`**:
   - Ensures unique vendor names are returned.

#### Output:
| vendor_name     |

| Winter Warmers  |
