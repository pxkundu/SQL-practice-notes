### 20. **Santaâ€™s elves are evaluating gift nutritional value. Write a query to find the top 3 gifts with the highest calorie density (calories per gram). Include gift_name, category, and calorie_density.**

#### Table: `gift_nutrition`
| gift_id | gift_name       | category  | calories | weight_g |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| 1       | Chocolate Bar   | Sweets    | 250      | 100      |
| 2       | Candy Cane      | Sweets    | 200      | 150      |
| 3       | Fruitcake       | Baked     | 400      | 250      |
| 4       | Gingerbread Man | Baked     | 500      | 350      |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    gift_name,
    category,
    (calories / weight_g) AS calorie_density
FROM 
    gift_nutrition
ORDER BY 
    calorie_density DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Calorie Density Calculation**:
   - Divides `calories` by `weight_g` to calculate the calorie density for each gift.
2. **Sorting**:
   - Orders gifts by calorie density in descending order to find the most calorie-dense items.
3. **Limiting**:
   - Restricts the output to the top 3 results.

#### Output:
| gift_name       | category  | calorie_density |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Chocolate Bar   | Sweets    | 2.50            |
| Gingerbread Man | Baked     | 1.43            |
| Fruitcake       | Baked     | 1.60            |

### 21. **Santa is preparing his list of naughty and nice children. Write a query to calculate the number of nice and naughty children in each region.**

#### Table: `children`
| child_id | child_name   | region        | status   |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| 1        | Cindy Lou   | Whoville      | nice     |
| 2        | Max the Dog | Whoville      | nice     |
| 3        | The Grinch  | Mount Crumpit | naughty  |
| 4        | Sam Who     | Whoville      | nice     |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    region,
    status,
    COUNT(child_id) AS child_count
FROM 
    children
GROUP BY 
    region, status
ORDER BY 
    region, status;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`GROUP BY region, status`**:
   - Groups the children by their region and status (nice or naughty).
2. **`COUNT(child_id)`**:
   - Counts the number of children for each region and status.
3. **Sorting**:
   - Orders results by region and status for clarity.

#### Output:
| region        | status   | child_count |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Mount Crumpit | naughty  | 1           |
| Whoville      | nice     | 3           |

### 22. **A candy store owner wants to calculate the total revenue for each candy category. Write a query to rank candy categories by their total revenue.**

#### Table: `candy_sales`
| sale_id | candy_name         | category     | quantity_sold | price_per_unit |
|---------|--------------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

| 3       | Lollipop           | Sweets       | 5             | 0.75           |
| 4       | Dark Chocolate     | Chocolate    | 8             | 2.5            |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(quantity_sold * price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    candy_sales
GROUP BY 
    category
ORDER BY 
    total_revenue DESC;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Revenue Calculation**:
   - Multiplies `quantity_sold` by `price_per_unit` to calculate revenue for each candy sale.
2. **`GROUP BY category`**:
   - Groups results by candy category to aggregate the revenue.
3. **Sorting**:
   - Orders categories by total revenue in descending order.

#### Output:
| category     | total_revenue |
|--------------|---------------|
| Sweets       | 37.25         |
| Chocolate    | 36.00         |

### 23. **Find the top 3 ski resorts with the highest snowfall in December 2024. Include resort_name and snowfall_inches.**

#### Table: `ski_resorts`
| resort_id | resort_name         | location   |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| 1         | Snowy Peaks         | Colorado   |
| 2         | Winter Wonderland   | Utah       |
| 3         | Frozen Slopes       | Alaska     |

#### Table: `snowfall`
| snowfall_id | resort_id | snowfall_inches | date       |

| 3           | 3         | 75              | 2024-12-22 |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    sr.resort_name,
    sf.snowfall_inches
FROM 
    ski_resorts sr
JOIN 
    snowfall sf ON sr.resort_id = sf.resort_id
WHERE 
    sf.date BETWEEN '2024-12-01' AND '2024-12-31'
ORDER BY 
    sf.snowfall_inches DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`JOIN`**:
   - Joins `ski_resorts` with `snowfall` to retrieve snowfall data for each resort.
2. **Date Filtering**:
   - Filters snowfall records to include only those from December 2024.
3. **Sorting and Limiting**:
   - Orders results by snowfall in descending order and limits output to the top 3 resorts.

#### Output:
| resort_name         | snowfall_inches |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Frozen Slopes       | 75              |
| Snowy Peaks         | 60              |
| Winter Wonderland   | 45              |

#### Table: `routes`
| route_id | country      | gifts_delivered |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|

| 3        | Mexico       | 200             |

#### Solution:

SELECT 
    country,
    SUM(gifts_delivered) AS total_gifts
FROM 
    routes

    country
ORDER BY 
    total_gifts DESC;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`SUM(gifts_delivered)`**:
   - Calculates the total number of gifts delivered for each country.
2. **`GROUP BY country`**:
   - Groups the data by country to aggregate the gift totals.
3. **Sorting**:
   - Orders the results by total gifts in descending order.
