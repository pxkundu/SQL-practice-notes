#### Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    sb.bin_id
FROM 
    storage_bins sb
LEFT JOIN 
    material_movements mm 
    ON sb.bin_id = mm.from_bin OR sb.bin_id = mm.to_bin
WHERE 
    (mm.moved_at IS NULL OR mm.moved_at < DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE()))
GROUP BY 
    sb.bin_id
HAVING 
    COUNT(mm.movement_id) = 0;
```

#### Explanation:
- Uses `LEFT JOIN` to find bins with no movements in the last 30 days.

#### Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    material_id,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN movement_type = 'OUT' THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) /
     NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN movement_type = 'IN' THEN quantity ELSE 0 END), 0)) AS turnover_rate
FROM 
    material_movements
GROUP BY 
    material_id;
```

#### Explanation:
- Computes turnover rate as the ratio of `OUT` to `IN` movements.
- Uses `NULLIF` to avoid division by zero errors.
