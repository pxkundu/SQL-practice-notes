### 16. **Scientists are studying the diets of polar bears. Write a query to find the maximum amount of food (in kilograms) consumed by each polar bear in a single meal December 2024. Include the bear_name and biggest_meal_kg, and sort the results in descending order of largest meal consumed.**

#### Table: `polar_bears`
| bear_id | bear_name | age |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| 1       | Snowball  | 10  |
| 2       | Frosty    | 7   |
| 3       | Iceberg   | 15  |

#### Table: `meal_log`
| log_id | bear_id | food_type | food_weight_kg | date       |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| 1      | 1       | Seal      | 30             | 2024-12-01 |
| 2      | 2       | Fish      | 15             | 2024-12-02 |
| 3      | 1       | Fish      | 10             | 2024-12-03 |
| 4      | 3       | Seal      | 25             | 2024-12-04 |
| 5      | 2       | Seal      | 20             | 2024-12-05 |
| 6      | 3       | Fish      | 18             | 2024-12-06 |

#### Solution:
```sql
WITH MaxMeals AS (
    SELECT 
        pb.bear_name,
        MAX(ml.food_weight_kg) AS biggest_meal_kg
    FROM 
        polar_bears pb
    JOIN 
        meal_log ml ON pb.bear_id = ml.bear_id
    WHERE 
        ml.date BETWEEN '2024-12-01' AND '2024-12-31'
    GROUP BY 
        pb.bear_name
)
SELECT 
    bear_name,
    biggest_meal_kg
FROM 
    MaxMeals
ORDER BY 
    biggest_meal_kg DESC;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`WITH MaxMeals`**:
   - Joins `polar_bears` and `meal_log` tables to calculate the maximum `food_weight_kg` consumed in a single meal for each bear during December 2024.
   - Filters the meals to include only those recorded in December.
2. **Main Query**:
   - Sorts the bears by their largest meal size in descending order.

#### Output:
| bear_name | biggest_meal_kg |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Snowball  | 30              |
| Iceberg   | 25              |
| Frosty    | 20              |

### 17. **Santa wants to evaluate his sleigh’s weight distribution. Write a query to calculate the total weight of gifts for each recipient.**

#### Table: `gifts`
| gift_id | gift_name         | recipient | weight_kg |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1       | Toy Train         | John      | 2.5       |
| 2       | Chocolate Box     | Alice     | 0.8       |
| 3       | Teddy Bear        | Sophia    | 1.2       |
| 4       | Board Game        | John      | 0.9       |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    recipient,
    SUM(weight_kg) AS total_weight
FROM 
    gifts
GROUP BY 
    recipient;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`GROUP BY recipient`**:
   - Groups the gifts by each recipient to calculate the total weight of gifts they are receiving.
2. **`SUM(weight_kg)`**:
   - Computes the total weight of gifts for each recipient.

#### Output:
| recipient | total_weight |
|-----------|--------------|
| John      | 3.4          |
| Alice     | 0.8          |
| Sophia    | 1.2          |

### 18. **The Grinch tracked the total calories in his holiday feasts. Write a query to find the total calories consumed in each feast, sorted by feast name.**

#### Table: `feasts`
| feast_id | feast_name          | date       |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| 1        | Christmas Eve Feast | 2024-12-24 |
| 2        | New Year’s Feast    | 2024-12-31 |

#### Table: `feast_food`
| food_id | feast_id | food_name      | calories |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------|
| 1       | 1        | Roast Turkey   | 3500     |
| 2       | 1        | Stuffing       | 500      |
| 3       | 2        | Champagne      | 150      |
| 4       | 2        | Cheesecake     | 450      |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    f.feast_name,
    SUM(ff.calories) AS total_calories
FROM 
    feasts f
JOIN 
    feast_food ff ON f.feast_id = ff.feast_id
GROUP BY 
    f.feast_name
ORDER BY 
    f.feast_name;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`JOIN`**:
   - Joins `feasts` and `feast_food` tables to combine feast names with their corresponding food items.
2. **`GROUP BY f.feast_name`**:
   - Groups the results by feast name to calculate the total calories for each feast.
3. **Sorting**:
   - Orders results alphabetically by feast name.

#### Output:
| feast_name          | total_calories |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Christmas Eve Feast | 4000           |
| New Year’s Feast    | 600            |

### 19. **The Grinch wants to plan pranks on those with the most valuable items. Find the top 3 gifts in terms of price-to-weight ratio (price per kg). Include gift_name and ratio.**

#### Table: `gifts`
| gift_id | gift_name       | price_usd | weight_kg |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1       | Toy Train       | 25        | 2.5       |
| 2       | Chocolate Box   | 10        | 0.8       |
| 3       | Teddy Bear      | 20        | 1.2       |
| 4       | Board Game      | 15        | 0.9       |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    gift_name,
    (price_usd / weight_kg) AS price_to_weight_ratio
FROM 
    gifts
ORDER BY 
    price_to_weight_ratio DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Price-to-Weight Calculation**:
   - Computes the ratio of `price_usd` to `weight_kg` for each gift.
2. **Sorting**:
   - Orders gifts by the highest price-to-weight ratio in descending order.
3. **Limiting**:
   - Returns the top 3 results.

#### Output:
| gift_name       | price_to_weight_ratio |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Chocolate Box   | 12.50                |
| Board Game      | 16.67                |
| Teddy Bear      | 16.67                |
