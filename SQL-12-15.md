### 12. **The Grinch tracked his weight every day in December to analyze how it changed daily. Write a query to return the weight change (in pounds) for each day, calculated as the difference from the previous day's weight.**

#### Table: `grinch_weight_log`
| log_id | day_of_month | weight |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1      | 1            | 250    |
| 2      | 2            | 248    |
| 3      | 3            | 249    |
| 4      | 4            | 247    |
| 5      | 5            | 246    |
| 6      | 6            | 248    |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    g1.day_of_month,
    g1.weight,
    (g1.weight - g2.weight) AS weight_change
FROM 
    grinch_weight_log g1
LEFT JOIN 
    grinch_weight_log g2 ON g1.day_of_month = g2.day_of_month + 1
ORDER BY 
    g1.day_of_month;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`LEFT JOIN`**:
   - Joins the `grinch_weight_log` table with itself, matching each day's weight with the weight from the previous day by `day_of_month`.
2. **Weight Change Calculation**:
   - Calculates the difference in weight between the current day (`g1.weight`) and the previous day (`g2.weight`).
3. **Sorting**:
   - Ensures results are ordered chronologically by `day_of_month`.

#### Output:
| day_of_month | weight | weight_change |
|--------------|--------|---------------|
| 1            | 250    | NULL          |
| 2            | 248    | -2            |
| 3            | 249    | 1             |
| 4            | 247    | -2            |
| 5            | 246    | -1            |
| 6            | 248    | 2             |

### 13. **Santa is tracking how many presents he delivers each night leading up to Christmas. He wants a running total to see how many gifts have been delivered so far on any given night. Using the deliveries table, calculate the cumulative sum of gifts delivered, ordered by the delivery date.**

#### Table: `deliveries`
| delivery_date | gifts_delivered |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 2024-12-20    | 120             |
| 2024-12-21    | 150             |
| 2024-12-22    | 200             |
| 2024-12-23    | 300             |
| 2024-12-24    | 500             |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    delivery_date,
    gifts_delivered,
    SUM(gifts_delivered) OVER (ORDER BY delivery_date) AS running_total
FROM 
    deliveries
ORDER BY 
    delivery_date;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`SUM(gifts_delivered) OVER (ORDER BY delivery_date)`**:
   - Uses a window function to calculate the cumulative sum (`running_total`) of `gifts_delivered` up to the current row, ordered by `delivery_date`.
2. **Sorting**:
   - Ensures the results are ordered by `delivery_date`.

#### Output:
| delivery_date | gifts_delivered | running_total |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-20    | 120             | 120           |
| 2024-12-21    | 150             | 270           |
| 2024-12-22    | 200             | 470           |
| 2024-12-23    | 300             | 770           |
| 2024-12-24    | 500             | 1270          |

### 14. **Santa is analyzing his deliveries to determine which days had the heaviest loads. Write a query to calculate the daily total weight of gifts delivered.**

#### Table: `deliveries`
| delivery_date | gifts_delivered | weight_kg |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 2024-12-20    | 120             | 360       |
| 2024-12-21    | 150             | 450       |
| 2024-12-22    | 200             | 600       |
| 2024-12-23    | 300             | 900       |
| 2024-12-24    | 500             | 1500      |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    delivery_date,
    gifts_delivered,
    weight_kg
FROM 
    deliveries
ORDER BY 
    weight_kg DESC;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**:
   - Returns `delivery_date`, `gifts_delivered`, and `weight_kg` to analyze the daily weight load.
2. **Sorting**:
   - Orders results by `weight_kg` in descending order to highlight the heaviest delivery days.

#### Output:
| delivery_date | gifts_delivered | weight_kg |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 2024-12-24    | 500             | 1500      |
| 2024-12-23    | 300             | 900       |
| 2024-12-22    | 200             | 600       |
| 2024-12-21    | 150             | 450       |
| 2024-12-20    | 120             | 360       |

### 15. **Find the beaches expected to have temperatures above 30°C on Christmas Day. Include their beach_name and temperature.**

#### Table: `beach_temperature_predictions`
| beach_name      | country       | expected_temperature_c | date       |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Bondi Beach      | Australia    | 32                      | 2024-12-24 |
| Copacabana Beach | Brazil       | 28                      | 2024-12-24 |
| Clifton Beach    | South Africa | 31                      | 2024-12-25 |
| Brighton Beach   | New Zealand  | 25                      | 2024-12-25 |

#### Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
    beach_name,
    expected_temperature_c
FROM 
    beach_temperature_predictions
WHERE 
    expected_temperature_c > 30 AND date = '2024-12-25';
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`WHERE expected_temperature_c > 30`**:
   - Filters beaches with temperatures above 30°C.
2. **`AND date = '2024-12-25'`**:
   - Ensures only beaches forecasted for Christmas Day (December 25, 2024) are included.

#### Output:
| beach_name      | expected_temperature_c |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Clifton Beach    | 31                      |
